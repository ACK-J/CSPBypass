# CSP Bypass

Welcome to **CSPBypass.com**, a tool designed to help ethical hackers bypass restrictive Content Security Policies (CSP) and exploit XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities on sites where injections are blocked by CSPs that only allow certain whitelisted domains.

## Website

Visit [CSPBypass.com](https://cspbypass.com) to search for existing CSP bypass gadgets that allow you to gain XSS, or contribute your own findings.

## What is a "CSP Bypass gadget"?

Modern websites often use **Content Security Policies (CSP)** to protect against XSS attacks by restricting the sources of executable scripts and other content. However, in some cases, even when an attacker can inject HTML/javascript into a site, the CSP blocks the payload, allowing only certain whitelisted domains or resources to load.

A **CSP bypass** is a technique or a gadget that allows the attacker to execute JavaScript or other code despite the restrictive policy, exploiting loopholes in the policy configuration.

## Purpose

This project is purely for **ethical purposes**. The tool and techniques shared here are intended to help security researchers, ethical hackers, and penetration testers identify potential CSP misconfigurations, responsibly disclose vulnerabilities, and improve web security overall.

**Note:** Always ensure that you have permission to test any website or system and follow all applicable laws and responsible disclosure practices.
